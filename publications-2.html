<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We consider a system composed of a bar tethered to two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where the cables behave as rigid links under tensile forces, and with the control objective of stabilizing the bar's pose around a desired pose. Each UAV is equipped with a PID control law, and we verify that the bar's motion is decomposable into three decoupled motions, namely a longitudinal, a lateral and a vertical. We then provide relations between the UAVs&rsquo; gains, which, if satisfied, allows us to decompose each of those motions into two cascaded motions; the latter relations between the UAVs&rsquo; gains are found so as to counteract the system asymmetries, such as the different cable lengths and the different UAVs&rsquo; weights. Finally, we provide conditions, based on the system's physical parameters, that describe good and bad types of asymmetries. We present experiments that demonstrate the stabilization of the bar's pose.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We propose a control law for stabilization of a bar tethered to two aerial vehicles, and provide conditions on the control law's gains that guarantee exponential stability of the equilibrium. Given the proposed control law, we analyze the stability of the equilibrium for two cases, specifically, for a bar of known and unknown mass. We provide lower bounds on the attitude gains of the UAVs&rsquo; attitude inner loop that guarantee exponential stability of the equilibrium. We also include an integral action term in the control law, so as to compensate for battery drainage and model mismatches, and we provide a lower bound on the integral gain that guarantees stability of the equilibrium. We present an experiment that demonstrates the stabilization and that validates the robustness of the proposed control law.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We consider a system composed of a bar tethered to two aerial vehicles, and develop a controller for pose tracking of the bar, i.e., a controller for position and attitude tracking. Our first control step is to provide an input and a state transformations which convert the system vector field into one that highlights the cascaded structure of the problem. We then design a controller for the transformed system by exploring that cascaded structure. There are three main contributions: i) we provide bounds on the linear and angular acceleration of the bar that guarantee well-posedness of the controller, and such bounds can be used when selecting the gains and saturations of bounded controllers for both three dimensional and unit vector double integrators; ii) the proposed control law includes a degree of freedom which can be used to regulate the relative position between the aerial vehicles; and iii) the proposed control law for the throttle guarantees that the cascaded structure of the problem is preserved. Simulations are presented which validate the proposed algorithm.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We model a point mass load tethered to two aerial vehicles, and propose a control strategy that guarantees that the load tracks a desired position trajectory. Our framework consists in designing an input and a state transformation which converts the quadrotors-load system into three decoupled subsystems: one concerning the position of the load, with dynamics similar to those of an under-actuated aerial vehicle; one concerning the angle between the cables, with double integrator dynamics; and another concerning the yaw motion of the plane formed by the cables, also with double integrator dynamics. Once the decoupling is done, controllers from the literature can be leveraged, which we take advantage of when controlling the subsystem with dynamics similar to those of an under-actuated aerial vehicle. Simulations are presented which validate the proposed algorithm.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We propose a control law for stabilization of a quadrotor-load system, and provide conditions on the control law's gains that guarantee exponential stability of the equilibrium. The system is composed of a load and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attached to each other by a cable of fixed length, which behaves as a rigid link under tensile forces; and the control input is composed of a three dimensional force requested to the UAV, which the UAV provides with or without delay. Given the proposed control law, we analyze the stability of the equilibrium in two separate parts. In the first, the system is modeled assuming that the UAV provides the requested control input without delay, and we verify that the equilibrium is exponentially stable. In the second part, the UAV is modeled as possessing an attitude inner loop, and we provide a lower bound on the attitude gain for which exponential stability of the equilibrium is preserved. An integral action term is also included in the control law, which compensates for battery drainage or model mismatches, such as an unknown load mass. We present experiments for different scenarios that demonstrate and validate the robustness of the proposed control law.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this paper, we study attitude synchronization for elements in the unit sphere of R3 and for elements in the 3D rotation group, for a network with switching topology. The agents’ angular velocities are assumed to be the control inputs, and a switching control law for each agent is devised that guarantees synchronization, provided that all elements are initially contained in a given region, unknown to the network. The control law is decentralized and it does not require a common orientation frame among all agents.We refer to synchronization of unit vectors in R3 as incomplete synchronization, and of 3D rotation matrices as complete synchronization. Our main contribution lies on showing that these two problems can be analyzed under a common framework, where all elements’ dynamics are transformed into unit vectors dynamics on a sphere of appropriate dimension. </p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this paper, we model an aerial vehicle, specifically a quadrotor, and a load attached to each other by a rigid link. We assume a torque input at the joint between the aerial vehicle and the rigid link is available. After modeling, we decouple the system dynamics in two separate subsystems, one concerning the position of the center of mass, which we control independently from the chosen torque input; and a second subsystem, concerning the attitude of the rigid link, which we control by appropriately designing a torque control law. Differential flatness is used to show that controlling these two separate systems is equivalent to controlling the complete system. We design control laws for the quadrotor thrust, the quadrotor angular velocity and the torque input, and provide convergence proofs that guarantee that the quadrotor follows asymptotically a desired position trajectory while the manipu- lator follows a desired orientation. Simulation and experimental works are presented which validate the proposed algorithms. </p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We present a controller for an underactuated system which is driven by a one dimensional linear acceleration/thrust along a direction vector, by a time-varying gravity, and by the angular acceleration of the direction vector. We propose state and time-dependent control laws for the linearand angular accelerations that guarantee that the position ofthe system is steered to the origin. The proposed control law depends on (i) a bounded control law for a double integrator system; and (ii) on a Lyapunov function that guarantees asymptotic stability of the origin for the double integrator system when controlled with the previous bounded control law. As such, the control law forms a family of control laws depending on (i) and (ii). The complete state space of the system, under the proposed control laws, has two equilibria, and by proper control design, a trajectory of the system is guaranteed to converge to only one of those. The overall design provides a common framework for controlling different systems, such asquadrotors and slung load transportation systems.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We present a trajectory tracking controller for a quadrotor-load system, composed of a single load and a single unmanned aerial vehicle connected by a cable or rope. The load is modeled as a point mass while the aerial vehicle is assumed to be fully actuated, with thrust and attitude of the quadrotor as inputs to the system quadrotor-load. We assume there is a constant input disturbance at the thrust input, and a disturbance estimator is presented that guarantees that asymptotic tracking is guaranteed in the presence of such a disturbance. The load and the aerial vehicle are connected by a cable of fixed length that behaves as a rigid link under tensile forces, and as a non-rigid link when under compressive forces. The proposed controller guarantees that the cable is always under tensile forces, provided that the position trajectory to be tracked satisfies some mild conditions. The system quadrotor- load can be transformed into a form that resembles that of systems describing underactuated aerial vehicles, and for which a variety of control strategies have been proposed. In particular, we propose a controller based on a backstepping procedure in conjunction with a bounded double integrator controller. We present simulations validating the proposed control algorithm, and some preliminary experimental results are also presented.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this paper we study a family of controllers that guarantees attitude synchronization for a network of elements in the unit sphere domain, i.e., S<sup>2</sup>. </p>
<p>We propose distributed continuous controllers for elements whose dynamics are controllable (i.e., control with torque as command), and which can be implemented by each individual agent without the need of a common global orientation frame among the network, i.e., it requires only local information that can be measured by each individual agent from its own orientation frame. </p>
<p>The controllers are specified according to arbitrary distance functions in S<sup>2</sup>, and we provide conditions on those distance functions that guarantee that i) a synchronized network of agents is locally asymptotically stable for an arbitrary connected network topology; ii) a synchronized network can be achieved for almost all initial conditions in a tree graph network.</p>
<p>We also study the equilibria configurations that come with specific types of network graphs.</p>
<p>The proposed strategies can be used in attitude synchronization of swarms of fully actuated rigid bodies, such as satellites.</p>
